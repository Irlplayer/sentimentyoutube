# Sentiment-Analysis-of-comments-on-Youtube-videos

In this project, we haveattempted to analyse the comments corresponding to YouTube videos and categorise them into positive and negative categories and represent the same pictorially via an effective user interface. YouTube comments are imported the YouTube Data API and the data is cleaned by removing emoticons and URLs. The application takes a YouTube video URL as an input and analyses the comments on the particular video using the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify the overall sentiment as positive or negative and express the opinion graphically. The model was trained on a pre-categorized dataset of words and achieved an of 94.6%. The various libraries used were Scipy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, NLTK in Python.
